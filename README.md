# TimerElement

This is a simple web component built using Angular Elements.

# Dependencies

I have used this tools:

* Angular 6.1.8
* Angular CLI 6.2.3.
* Node.js 9.5.9
* npm 5.6.0

If you use different versions your could find some problems for installing it properly.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 
Here you will find the timer component and you can interact with it.
See how the component is reloaded if you change any of the source files.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the component files. 
The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/timer-element` directory.
